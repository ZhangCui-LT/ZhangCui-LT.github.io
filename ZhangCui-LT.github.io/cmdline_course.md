# Introduction to the course
# 1. Week1：Introduction to command-line environments
This week introduces how to set up the command line environments, which is essential. After this, this week includes  command line basics  and  introduces terminal-based text editors, such as, nano. I have a good command of this aprt as I practiced a lot on the command line basic through this course. What I specifically learnt from this week:
* List the contents of my current directory,
* Change my current directory, 
* Download contents from the internet, 
* Display a text file using less,
* Create and remove files and directories,
* Copy, rename and move files,
* Open and edit a file in text editor

# 2. Week2: Navigating a UNIX System
This week introduces how to navigate a UNIX system, how to copy, move and remove directories. In addition,  we also learn how to get the permission from the system and process management and how to deal with a remote server as well. I still can not form a remote connection to a server smoothly and have some problems on copying files to and from a server using scp. Meanwhile, to be specific, what I learnt from this week:
* Copy, move and delete a directory.
* Visit the root directory of my system
* Compress a file and a directory using gzip and tar.
* Find out and change the read and write permissions for a file.
* Find the PID of a process and kill it.
* Run commands in the background.

# 3.Week3: Basic Corpus Processing
This week introduces how to use text processing tools in UNIX. It introduces different character encodings and structured text files. For now I think I forgot some of steps to process the texts, for example, removing duplicate lines from a text file, and need a review on this part. What I specifically learnt from this week:
* Know about the difference between the ASCII, Latin-1 and utf-8 encoding systems
* Convert a text file from Latin-1 to utf-8 encoding
* Print the first N lines and last N lines of a text file
* Count the number of lines, words and characters in a text file  
* Transform all upper case characters in a text file into lower case characters
* Sort the lines in a file into alphabetical and numerical order
* Find all lines in a text file which start with an upper case character
* Search for patterns in files
* Cut columns from formatted text files
* Paste columns into formatted text files
* Save results of your operations as a new file (using >)

# 4.Week4: Advanced Corpus Processing
This week introduces more complex command pipelines and a very important sed command, and use regular expressions with sed. I would say, from this part, it is getting harder, and for me it's a bit abstract to use regular expressions fully correctly. Sometimes I easily made some errors when processing texts. What I learnt from this week:
* Delete lines from a file using sed
* Find and replace patterns from a file using sed
* Use regular expressions with sed
* Understand how commands can be piped in UNIX using "|"
* Generate a frequency list from a text file
* Generate sentence per line format from a text file
* Transform a text file into a list of word n-grams
  
# 5.Week5: Scripting and Configuration Files
This week introduces use scripts to solve some complex problems, the concept of environment variables in UNIX systems and how to set up a confirgution file for myself. For now I feel I vaguely remember how to do a confirgution file, what i still remember the content i learnt:
* Write simple Scripts
* Know about what the if statement does
* See the values ​​of existing environment variables using echo
* Change their values ​​of existing environment variables and define new ones using export
* Make these settings permanent by placing them into your .bashrc / .bash_profile file.

# 6.Week6: Installing and Running Programs
This weeks talks about installing python packages by using pip command, sudo command and make command, a Utility for building projects like collections of text data. This week's learning content for me is very important and useful in the future study. What I learnt from this week:
* Use sudo, brew,pip
* Install software in your system using apt-get or brew
* Install python packages using pip
* Create a python virtual environment and install packages in that environment
* Write a Makefile and run it

# 7.Week 7: Version Control
This week primarily talks about the version control platform, mainly Github. It introduces how to se up a github account and make branches and repository. This part builds a quite significant foundation to help to finish the final assignment. From my perspective, it is really practical and i would use the version control a lot in the following studies. To be specific, what I learnt from this week:
* Understand what it is, and why we should use version control
* Know how to use add, commit and push changes to keep files updated, and set up a repository in Github
* Clone repository in my local computer
* Know to used checkout to undo the changes you made by reverting to a previous commit version.
* Create a branch and merge a branch into my master branch.
  
# Final assessment: Building Webpages using GitHub Pages
The final project is to create my own GitHub page by using what i learnt from the course. It includes three parts to be done: editing index.md, adding a CV and adding a markdown file cmdline_course.md. It is a very practical and interesting task!
